Convert KML to ASC or PRN to KML files of Geodeshical Points.

If you have a KML file and you want to have the data as ASC you can use this program to convert the points of the file.
If you have a PRN file and you want to have the data as KML you can use this program to convert the points of the file.

KML is the standar file of Google Maps.

Fernando wanted this program because he uses another program and cannot read KML files :)
